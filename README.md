# Inevitable Zero

A mod for *Trails from Zero* that ports over the PS Vita-exclusive quests to the
PC version. The translation is a work in progress.

<details><summary>Ultimate Bread Showdown!</summary>
In chapter 2, first day, after returning from Armorica Village.

The result is announced in chapter 3, second day.

For this one I also rename «Luscious Orange» to «Zesty Orange», because
I couldn't find any other way to get the translation to make sense.

Chapter 2, second day.

After talking to Azel, he disappears until you leave and come back. I don't know
if this is how it works in the Vita version or if it's a bug in this patch.

I haven't figured out if it's possible to change the detective rank milestones,
so since this mod adds a total of 14 extra DP, those are somewhat easier to
reach.

It also contains a small number of other patches:

<details><summary>Some exclamations from Fran when she calls</summary>
When asking the gang to find Colin, and after exploring the Moon Temple.
</details>
<details><summary>One small line during a discussion with Sergei, which solves a minor plot hole (spoilers!)</summary>
When discussing the D∴G Cult, Sergei writes down how it is spelled.

## Installation

Download the `.tar.gz` file from the latest [release](https://github.com/Kyuuhachi/Inevitable-Zero/releases)
and extract `data/` directory into the game's directory. This is normally at
`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\The Legend of Heroes Trails from Zero`,
or it can be found by right-clicking the game in Steam and choosing Manage » Browse local files.

## Compatibility

Tested to work on PC versions 1.3.5 and 1.3.7.
Also works on the Nintendo Switch version, though this of course requires jailbreaking.

Inevitable Zero is not compatible with ShinKiseki's [More Portraits in Zero](https://github.com/shinkiseki/MorePortraitsInZero);
since it is in active development it would not be feasible for either of us to maintain a compatibility patch.
We will be looking into a solution once More Portraits is in a less volatile state.
