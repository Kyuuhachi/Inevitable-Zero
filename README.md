# Inevitable Zero

A mod for *Trails from Zero* that ports over the PS Vita-exclusive quests to the
PC version. The translation is a work in progress.

In chapter 2, first day, after returning from Armorica Village.

The result is announced in chapter 3, second day.

For this one I also rename «Luscious Orange» to «Zesty Orange», because
I couldn't find any other way to get the translation to make sense.

After talking to Azel, he disappears until you leave and come back. I don't know
if this is how it works in the Vita version or if it's a bug in this patch.

I have not found any way to change the detective rank milestones,
so since this mod adds a total of 14 extra DP, those are somewhat easier to reach.

It also contains a small number of other patches:

When asking the gang to find Colin, and after exploring the Moon Temple.

When discussing the D∴G Cult, Sergei writes down how it is spelled.

## Installation

Download the `inevitable.zip` file from the latest [release](https://github.com/Kyuuhachi/Inevitable-Zero/releases)
and extract `data/` directory into the game's directory (you can open it like a .zip file).
This is normally at
`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\The Legend of Heroes Trails from Zero`,
or it can be found by right-clicking the game in Steam and choosing Manage » Browse local files.

### Inevitable Portraits

ShinKiseki's [More Portraits in Zero](https://github.com/shinkiseki/MorePortraitsInZero) modifies some of the same files as Inevitable Zero, and is thus not directly compatible. Instead there is a separate version of the mod, which should be installed after after More Portraits. The base Inevitable Zero is not required.


## Compatibility

Inevitable Zero was built against Steam version 1.4.12. The differences between different versions are minor, so there will be no issues if using the mod on a different version.
It also works on the Nintendo Switch version, though this of course requires jailbreaking.

Inevitable Portraits was built against [More Portraits in Zero](https://github.com/shinkiseki/MorePortraitsInZero) version 1.3.0, which was also built against 1.4.12.

## FAQ

**Can I install this mid-playthrough?** Yes. But I can't guarantee stability if
you are in an area with added NPCs, so I would recommend saving on one of the
highways.

**Do these support English/Japanese?** Yes, both languages are fully supported.

**Are they voiced?** No. They're not voiced in Evolution, so there are no voice
clips for them.

**Do you receive any DP?/Does this affect achievements?** Yes, it does make
detective ranks easier to attain since there are more DP in total. I believe
adjusting the rank thresholds would require modding the exe, which is beyond
the scope of this mod.
