# Inevitable Zero

A mod for *Trails from Zero* that ports over the PS Vita-exclusive quests to the
PC version. Works with the original Japanese release and Geofront *version 1.0.2
only*. The translation is a work in progress.

* Ultimate Bread Showdown!
	<details>
	In chapter 2, first day, after returning from Armorica Village.

	The result is announced in chapter 3, second day.

	For this one I also rename «Luscious Orange» to «Zesty Orange», because I couldn't find any other way to get the translation to make sense.
